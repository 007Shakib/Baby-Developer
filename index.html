            <p>I am a tech enthusiast and creative problem-solver. With a passion for all things tech, I enjoys
                exploring
                the latest gadgets, software, and innovations that are shaping the world around us. As a curious and
                detail-oriented individual, I am always seeking to understand the inner workings of technology and how
                it
                can be used to improve our lives.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
